### [1. What is Econometrics?](https://kristran90.github.io/blog/2020/05/17/What-is-Econometrics)
Econometrics means "Economic measurement". There are some definitions of "Econometrics":
>Econometrics, the result of a certain outlook on the role of economics, consists of the application of mathematical statistics to economic data to lend empirical support to the models constructed by mathematical economics and to obtain numerical results. **- Gerhard Tintner, Methodology of Mathematical Economics and Econometrics**

>. . . econometrics may be defined as the quantitative analysis of actual economic phenomena based on the concurrent development of theory and observation, related by appropriate methods of inference. - **2P. A. Samuelson, T. C. Koopmans, and J. R. N. Stone, “Report of the Evaluative Committee for Econometrica,” Econometrica**

### [2. What are the main roles in Economics?](https://kristran90.github.io/blog/2020/05/17/What-is-Econometrics)
* Economic theory makes statements or hypotheses that are mostly qualitative in nature.
* Mathematical economics express economic theory in mathematical form (equations) without regard to measurability or empirical verification of the theory.
* Economic statistics is mainly concerned with collecting, processing, and presenting economic data in the form of charts and tables.
