This is my personal blog plan

### Motivation:
I want to create a personal blog to write about my learning path and share my experience.

### Goals:
1. **[Immediate]** Create a blog on Github Pages by using Jekyll
2. **[Shorter-term]** Share my learning path about Math, Economics and Programming 
3. **[Medium-term]** Upload my research and projects. Use them to get a data science job
4. **[Longer-term]** Share my idea and thoughts about anything around me
